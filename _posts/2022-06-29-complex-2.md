title: "Chapter 1.2"
---

In the first unit, we'll cover material related to Johnston's chapter 1.2, including analytic functions, and some fundamental theorems - infinite differentiability, extension, identity. We'll also discuss the relationship between holomorphic and analytic. (A followup on complex exponentials and the polar representation will be posted in this unit).

#### Suggested Problems

Bold problems are more challenging.

- J1.2 2, 9, 19, 21, 29, 47 (note here using Ratio Test, which is easier to compute with than the Root test), 57, 58
- Theory: 65, 17, **75-77**
